# v6 19th March 2024 (Current Setup)

**Keyboard**: [Moonlander Mark 1](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander). The keyboard is beautiful and so versatile. I run an extra wide setup to keep my chest and shoulders open as I work. I also invested in [The Platform](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/platform) for extreme tenting angles on a rock solid base that packs down to almost nothing.

**Keyboard Layout**: Custom Colemak-DH layout with extendable layers. The layers are the true powerhouse of the keyboard as they let me perform many actions that are difficult or impossible with
a traditional keyboard setup.

**Mouse**: [Logitech MX Ergo](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.html) with the blue trackball swapped over from my old [M575](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/mice/m575-ergo-wireless-trackball.910-005872.html?sp=2&searchclick=logi).

**Laptop**: [Alienware M14xR2](https://icecat.biz/en/p/alienware/v510612sgwin8/notebooks-m14x+-r2-16754855.html) I got this beauty second hand just over a decade ago. I've maxed out the RAM and swapped the hard dive for an SSD. It just keeps going, despite a lot of abuse.
Performance definitely isn't amazing any more, but since most of my high power computing is done in the cloud, it doesn't matter. I am eventually going to swap it out, but until then I'm making the most of it.

**Monitor**: [Samsung 28" UHD](https://www.samsung.com/uk/monitors/high-resolution/ur55-28-inch-ips-uhd-4k-lu28r550uqpxxu/) In hindsight, 27" would be the perfect size for my current setup. But I got a good deal on this and it works well. If you look closely, you'll see it's mounted upside down. The VESA threads are towards the top of the monitor (in normal orientation) and this meant that, even with my extra tall mount, I couldn't quite get the height I wanted without flipping the monitor.

**Monitor Mount**: [Invision Dual Gas Assisted Arms](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B091ZK3DPV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) These were the tallest gas assisted arms I could find. I love their easy adjustability as I regularly swing my monitor to one side to use my teleprompter for Zoom calls. They're just about tall enough using the upside down monitor hack mentioned above.
