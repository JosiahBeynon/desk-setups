First attempt at a treadmill desk. Created using a manual treadmill, jacked up to a steeper angle so it ran by iteslf, and shoving a board over the handles for the desk.

I was attached to the treadmill handle by a bungee cord which looper around my waist. Otherwise I'd fall off the bottom of the treadmill over time.
